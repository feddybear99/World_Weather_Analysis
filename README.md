# Module # 6 Challenge: World_Weather_Analysis

 

In this challenge, we're asked to help Jack (who works for the app PLANMYTRIP), collect and present data for customers via the "search" page, which they will then filter based on their preferred travel criteria in order to find their ideal hotel anywhere in the world. 

Jack needs help answering a question: How might we provide real-time suggestions for our client's ideal hotels? My first task was to define what customers meant by "ideal." So, over the course of the conversation, I narrowed that hotels were (1) within a given range of latitude and longitude and that (2) provided the right kind of weather for the customers criteria.

Customers were primarily interested in finding hotel locations around the world that had a weather range between 75°- 90°(Fahrenheit (°F).

Here was the first map that populated with the temperature parameters between 75°- 90°(Fahrenheit (°F):

To narrow in and create an example itinerary, I chose to foocus on (four) hotels in Northern California as an example of hotels with temperature parameters between 75°- 90°(Fahrenheit (°F):

Up close, these hotels show:

Here's an organized rundown of the itinerary that might be easier to read first glance:

My first choice to start my trip would definitely be going to The Ritz-Carlton, Half Moon Bay
